PearlThoughts Assignment:
Implement API endpoints for an out-patient appointment system. Doctors practice on a weekly schedule. 
For simplicity, let's assume they practice on only one location, only on evenings, may consult X number of patients and always leave on Sundays.  
API implementation is expected for doctors listing, doctor detail page and appointment booking.
